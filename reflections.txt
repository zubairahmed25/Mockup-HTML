* I have learned HTML so far. I can type and use tags quicker than before. I learned new features like horizontal rules, strikethrough, and superscript when I was doing the project. 

*Some of the stuff I did in HTML have been easy since I’ve used them before.

*Nothing so far.

*Whenever I got stuck, or something I don’t know, I used references from the web.
